They are advocates, fundraisers, storytellers, event organizers, and everyday heroes helping to bridge the gap between diagnosis and access to treatment.',
  p2: 'When you volunteer with ACCE, you help ensure that no one faces cancer alone—especially those who cannot afford care.',
  p3: 'Whether you have a few hours a month or time to take on a larger project, your skills, passion, and presence matter. From helping with events, to raising awareness online, to offering professional expertise—we’ll help you find a role that fits your interests and makes real impact.',
  h2: 'Why volunteer?',
  p4: 'Because equity in cancer care doesn’t happen by accident. It happens because people like you choose to show up, speak out, and serve.',
  p5: 'Join us. Be the reason someone gets the care they need—and the hope they didn’t think was possible.',
